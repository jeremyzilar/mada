**Transformative ideas like MADA are only possible with the enthusiasm and collaboration of visionary partners!**

Over 60% of our funding to renovate these buildings will come from generous community members like you.

We are raising a total of $15m from private donors - your support will help us to launch Phase 1 in early 2026! AND….WE HAVE A MATCHING CHALLENGE!

As a transformational opportunity for MADA and our supporters, a generous donor has offered a $2.5 million gift to support Phase 1 – with a challenge. This gift comes with a 1:2 match requirement - meaning that they will contribute $1 for every $2 raised! This is a powerful chance to boost the impact of your gift. Every dollar you give brings us closer to unlocking the full match — and helps us make renovation progress faster.

Philanthropy is powerful when it’s collective. By stepping forward now, you’ll set the pace for MADA’s success and help create an arts and design hub that will serve the city for generations.

**Your gift will help us to:**

- **Renovate and reimagine** these landmark spaces to foster collaboration for young artists, makers, and creatives, plus programs for students of all ages.
- **Provide affordable space** for celebrated nonprofits that specialize in young artists, makers, and entrepreneurs.
- **Establish a sustainable operating model** that ensures long-term impact.
