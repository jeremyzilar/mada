Over 60% of our funding to renovate these buildings will come from generous community members like you.

We are raising a total of $15m from private donors - your support will help us to launch Phase 1 in early 2026!

**And… we have a matching challenge!** Every $2 raised will be matched by a generous donor by $1, up to $2.5 million! This is a powerful chance to boost the impact of your gift. Every dollar you give brings us closer to unlocking the full match — and helps us make renovation progress faster.

Philanthropy is powerful when it’s collective. By stepping forward now, you’ll set the pace for MADA’s success and help create an arts and design hub that will serve the city for generations.
