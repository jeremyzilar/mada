In 1999, the Visual Arts Center buildings, designed by Mexico City architect Ricardo Legorreta, were constructed. These buildings were a partnership between the Santa Fe Art Institute and the College of Santa Fe. At the time, SFAI was looking for a permanent home and the College was seeking world-class arts facilities to enhance their arts curriculum.

In 2009, the College of Santa Fe closed and the City purchased the entire 64 acres, leasing it to Laureate who established the Santa Fe University of Art and Design (SFUAD). In 2018, when SFUAD closed, the City sent queries to other universities and eventually procured a Master Developer, KDC/ Cienda, in 2019, with a goal for them to redevelop the entire property. This fell apart during COVID in 2020.

In 2021, the City engaged the University of New Mexico Design and Planning Assistance Center (UNM DPAC) to develop a Public Engagement Plan. DPAC engaged with nine local non-profits, known as the Midtown Engagement Partners (MEPs), who worked together on a consensus basis to reach over 3000 residents, many of whom were youth, Spanish speakers, or from low income households. The engagement with these residents formed the Public Engagement Report to the City, which the City turned into the Community Development Plan.

The City of Santa Fe developed a Master Plan for the project, which will dictate how redevelopment will occur on site. They are also committed to funding a Neighborhood Stabilization Plan to mitigate the impact on neighboring districts.
