MIDTOWN ARTS AND DESIGN ALLIANCE
MADA will be one of the City’s first projects at the Midtown site as part of the City’s Midtown Master Plan. MADA will inhabit 4 acres of the total 64 acres that the City is redeveloping. MADA will renovate the Visual Arts Center, designed by Ricardo Legorreta, and the last remaining WWII military barracks to provide over 50,000 square feet of creative and cultural space for participating organizations and the Santa Fe community.

ASPECT STUDIOS
In December 2024, Aspect Film Studios was approved by the City to purchase of approx. 20 acres of the Midtown site to create world-class film production studios. In addition to film production studios, Aspect Studios plans to renovate The Screen, build approx. 300 units of housing, and renovate Driscoll Hall into a restaurant where Tender Fire pizza will be based. Together, MADA and Aspect Studios will help to ensure that the Midtown site continues as an arts, design, and creative cultural presence accessible to all Santa Feans.

Currently, the City is designing new infrastructure for the Midtown site, including new streets, stormwater management, and high speed internet. They will make open space improvements including an Arroyo Park and small Plaza. Infrastructure and site improvements for Phase 1 will start construction in 2026.
