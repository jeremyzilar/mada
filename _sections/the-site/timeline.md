In 1999, the Visual Arts Center buildings, designed by Mexico City architect Ricardo Legorreta, were constructed. These buildings were a partnership between the Santa Fe Art Institute and the College of Santa Fe. At the time, SFAI was looking for a permanent home and the College was seeking world-class arts facilities to enhance their arts curriculum.

In 2009, the College of Santa Fe closed and the City purchased the entire 64 acres, leasing it to Laureate who established the Santa Fe University of Art and Design (SFUAD). In 2018, when SFUAD closed, the City sent queries to other universities and eventually procured a Master Developer, KDC/ Cienda, in 2019, with a goal for them to redevelop the entire property. This fell apart during COVID in 2020.

In 2021, the City engaged the University of New Mexico Design and Planning Assistance Center (UNM DPAC) to develop a Public Engagement Plan. DPAC engaged with nine local non-profits, known as the Midtown Engagement Partners (MEPs), who worked together on a consensus basis to reach over 3000 residents, many of whom were youth, Spanish speakers, or from low income households. The engagement with these residents formed the Public Engagement Report to the City, which the City turned into the Community Development Plan.

### MADA Facilities

With Midtown land owned by the City, MADA will negotiate a long-term land lease and renovate and occupy over 50,000 square feet of the abandoned Visual Arts Center and Barracks. MADA has completed conditions assessments, cost estimates, and space planning for the following uses and shared programming. Phase 1 will redevelop 50% of the Visual Arts Center and allow move-in and operations for six MADA partners.

### Space Use & Programming

- Visual Arts Center (35,000 sq ft): Renovated spaces will include artist studios, galleries, youth-run café, an Indigenous center, a community lecture auditorium and multi-purpose community center ad gallery, darkrooms, printmaking, and nonprofit office and collaboration spaces.
- Barracks (17,000 sq ft): Renovated WWII structures will house youth ecological arts and construction training as well as expanded maker studios, including metal and wood workshops, plasma and laser cutters, metalsmithing and forging, and sewing and ceramic studios.
- Landscape and High Performance Energy Improvements: The shared site will have a community food garden and improved outdoor film screening and gathering spaces. All renovated buildings will be electrified and photovoltaic panels installed, per the city’s master plan.
