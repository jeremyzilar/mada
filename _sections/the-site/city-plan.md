### City Goals for the Entire Site

MADA is one of the first projects to move forward on the larger 64-acre site owned by the City of Santa Fe - which is the size of downtown Santa Fe!

The City developed a Master Plan for the project, which will include over 1000 homes, new streets and stormwater infrastructure, film studios, a City library, open spaces and parks, and renovation of the Greer Garson Performing Arts Theater.

They will also develop a Neighborhood Stabilization Plan to mitigate the impact on adjacent neighborhoods such as Hopewell Mann.
