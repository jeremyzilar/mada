With Midtown land owned by the City, MADA will negotiate a long-term land lease and renovate and occupy over 50,000 square feet of the abandoned Visual Arts Center and Barracks. MADA has completed conditions assessments, cost estimates, and space planning for the following uses and shared programming. Phase 1 will redevelop 50% of the Visual Arts Center and allow move-in and operations for six MADA partners.
