Before this was a campus, the Brunns Military Hospital in World War II was located here, treating survivors - including survivors of the Bataan Death March. These barracks also served as a first home for the Institute for American Indian Arts (IAIA).

In 1999, the Visual Arts Center buildings, designed by renowned Mexican architect Ricardo Legorreta, were constructed. The iconic Santa Fe Art Institute has been in continuous operation but the remaining three Visual Arts Center buildings have been vacant since the campus closed in 2018. These significant buildings will be rehabilitated and saved from further deterioration thanks to MADA!

The MADA project resulted from deep public engagement regarding the Midtown Siteâ€™s future. Many MADA partners and other local non-profits worked with the City and the UNM Design and Planning Assistance Center (UNM DPAC) to develop a Public Engagement Plan. Together we reached over 3000 residents, including many youth, Spanish speakers, and families from low income households, through events such as the 2021 Midtown Block Party, and provided a Public Engagement Report to the City.
