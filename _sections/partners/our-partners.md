Please contact us if you know a creative organization, startup, or collective that might be interested in partnering in Midtown! 75% of the MADA facilities will be dedicated to below-market rate rents for creative non-profits, as an investment in the critical infrastructure needed to maintain a healthy social sector and creative economy.
