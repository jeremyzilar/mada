deck: "The Midtown Arts and Design Alliance (MADA), a collaboration of over 10 trusted local and regional non-profits and cultural institutions,  is a once-in-a-generation opportunity for significant investment in Santa Fe’s creative community, located at its geographical center, Midtown."
---

The civic moment in which Santa Fe finds itself calls for fresh ideas that can take root on a disinvested site like the Midtown Site. While our city serves as an artistic capital to the country, it faces steep challenges of widening inequality and limited opportunity for its young people. Many of our own artists and creatives struggle to feel like they belong.

MADA will provide accessible, all-ages community programming, bridge traditional and new approaches, and champion experiential and technology-driven art forms — creating a vibrant gathering and making space for artists, designers, and cultural entrepreneurs of all ages.

By integrating job training and youth development with the arts, MADA will act as a connector to invaluable economic opportunities for creatives, young adults, aspiring entrepreneurs, families, and youth from all backgrounds.

MADA is the result of deep public engagement regarding the Midtown Site’s future. MADA partners will rehabilitate and occupy 50,000 sq ft of abandoned buildings at Midtown, with a long-term lease from the City of Santa Fe, as part of the City’s Midtown Master Plan.

### MADA is an innovative investment in smaller arts & culture non-profits and enterprises that bring new art, energy and ideas!

{% include common/button.html url="/partners" text="Our Partners" %}

MADA elevates celebrated nonprofits and institutions that share the vision of permanently colocating, co-programming, and sharing resources for greater collective impact.

As project stakeholders, MADA partners will fully or partially relocate here, paying below-market rents on a sliding scale to cover operating costs. This innovative model results in greater community impact, including:

- **Youth & Community Engagement** – internships and youth-led programming including a café, and a multi-purpose community room and lecture hall available to the public
- **Culture, Heritage & Health** – supporting all arts including traditional cultural practices, new media and technology, the culinary and healing arts, and ecological and construction arts
- **Affordable Arts & Culture Programs** – bringing over 10,000 residents and visitors annually to studios, galleries, makerspaces, lectures, performances, and events, and community spaces
- **Workforce Training & Job Creation** – helping to upskill individuals for in-demand careers in the creative economy, with classes, apprenticeships, and training for all ages

### Our goal is to break ground on Phase 1 in Q1 2026, allowing move-in for six MADA partners to provide photography, design, and cultural activities, film and media programming, a community darkroom and printmaking studio, a youth-run café, and a children’s makerspace!

We will need City Council approval this summer on the long term ground lease - please show up to support this once-in-a-generation project!
