MADA will have a long term ground $1 annual lease with the City to rehabilitate and occupy 50,000 sq ft of abandoned buildings at Midtown. This is a significant investment by the City in the creative and cultural non-profit sector and was listed as a priority of the City’s Master Plan, which resulted from deep public engagement regarding the Midtown Site’s future.

This is a unique model in Santa Fe, but many cities around the country are recognizing that strategic, civic investments like this encourage capacity-building and long-term sustainability in return for greater community benefits such as cultural leadership and belonging, environmental responsibility, and creative economic development.

As project stakeholders, MADA partners will contribute collectively to cover operating costs using a sliding scale based on capacity. This will allow us to collaborate, share resources and space, and co-develop programming, strengthening and expanding our ability to provide accessible arts and culture activities and events, and education, job, and training opportunities to the Santa Fe community.

We hope to negotiate the long term ground lease with the City this summer and hope that you will show up to support the project!
