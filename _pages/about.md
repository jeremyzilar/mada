MADA will rehabilitate and occupy 50,000 sq ft of abandoned buildings at Midtown, in partnership with the City of Santa Fe and as part of the City’s Midtown Master Plan.

MADA is a significant investment in the creative and cultural non-profit sector and resulted from deep public engagement regarding the Midtown Site’s future.

### MADA is an innovative investment in smaller arts & culture non-profits and enterprises that bring new art, energy and ideas!

{% include common/button.html url="/partners" text="Our Partners" %}

MADA elevates celebrated nonprofits and institutions that share the vision of permanently colocating, co-programming, and sharing resources for greater collective impact.

As project stakeholders, MADA partners will fully or partially relocate here, paying below-market rents on a sliding scale to cover operating costs. This innovative model results in greater community impact, including:

- **Youth & Community Engagement** – internships and youth-led programming including a café, and a multi-purpose community room and lecture hall available to the public
- **Culture, Heritage & Health** – supporting all arts including traditional cultural practices, new media and technology, the culinary and healing arts, and ecological and construction arts
- **Affordable Arts & Culture Programs** – bringing over 10,000 residents and visitors annually to studios, galleries, makerspaces, lectures, performances, and events, and community spaces
- **Workforce Training & Job Creation** – helping to upskill individuals for in-demand careers in the creative economy, with classes, apprenticeships, and training for all ages

### Our goal is to break ground on Phase 1 in Q1 2026, allowing move-in for 6 MADA partners to provide photography, design, and cultural activities, film and media programming, a community darkroom and printmaking studio, a youth-run café, and a children’s makerspace!

We will need City Council approval this summer on the long term ground lease - please show up to support this once-in-a-generation project!
