Before this was a campus, the Brunns Military Hospital in World War II was located here, treating survivors - including survivors of the Bataan Death March. These barracks also served as a first home for the Institute for American Indian Arts (IAIA).

### Visual Arts Center

In 1999, the Visual Arts Center buildings, designed by renowned Mexican architect Ricardo Legorreta, were constructed. The iconic Santa Fe Art Institute has been in continuous operation but the remaining three Visual Arts Center buildings have been vacant since the campus closed in 2018. These significant buildings will be rehabilitated thanks to the MADA project!

The MADA project resulted from deep public engagement regarding the Midtown Siteâ€™s future. Many MADA partners and other local non-profits worked with the City and the UNM Design and Planning Assistance Center (UNM DPAC) to develop a Public Engagement Plan. Together we reached over 3000 residents, including many youth, Spanish speakers, and families from low income households, through events such as the 2021 Midtown Block Party, and provided a Public Engagement Report to the City.

### City Goals for the Entire Site

MADA is one of the first projects to move forward on the larger 64-acre site owned by the City of Santa Fe - which is the size of downtown Santa Fe!

The City developed a Master Plan for the project, which will include over 1000 homes, new streets and stormwater infrastructure, film studios, a City library, open spaces and parks, and renovation of the Greer Garson Performing Arts Theater.

They will also develop a Neighborhood Stabilization Plan to mitigate the impact on adjacent neighborhoods such as Hopewell Mann.
