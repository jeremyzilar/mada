MADA is located on the Midtown property, which used to be the College of Santa Fe and SF University of Art and Design, and is now owned by the City of Santa Fe. In the 1940s the site was used as the Brunns Military Hospital, with over 200 barracks between Cerrillos and Siringo and treating survivors of the Bataan Death March.
