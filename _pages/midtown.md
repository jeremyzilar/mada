MADA is located on the Midtown property, which used to be the College of Santa Fe and SF University of Art and Design, and is now owned by the City of Santa Fe. In the 1940s the site was used as the Brunns Military Hospital, with over 200 barracks between Cerrillos and Siringo and treating survivors of the Bataan Death March.

In 1999, the Visual Arts Center buildings, designed by Mexico City architect Ricardo Legorreta, were constructed. These buildings were a partnership between the Santa Fe Art Institute and the College of Santa Fe. At the time, SFAI was looking for a permanent home and the College was seeking world-class arts facilities to enhance their arts curriculum.

In 2009, the College of Santa Fe closed and the City purchased the entire 64 acres, leasing it to Laureate who established the Santa Fe University of Art and Design (SFUAD). In 2018, when SFUAD closed, the City sent queries to other universities and eventually procured a Master Developer, KDC/ Cienda, in 2019, with a goal for them to redevelop the entire property. This fell apart during COVID in 2020.

In 2021, the City engaged the University of New Mexico Design and Planning Assistance Center (UNM DPAC) to develop a Public Engagement Plan. DPAC engaged with nine local non-profits, known as the Midtown Engagement Partners (MEPs), who worked together on a consensus basis to reach over 3000 residents, many of whom were youth, Spanish speakers, or from low income households. The engagement with these residents formed the Public Engagement Report to the City, which the City turned into the Community Development Plan.

The City of Santa Fe developed a Master Plan for the project, which will dictate how redevelopment will occur on site. They are also committed to funding a Neighborhood Stabilization Plan to mitigate the impact on neighboring districts.

### Current Projects

MIDTOWN ARTS AND DESIGN ALLIANCE
MADA will be one of the City’s first projects at the Midtown site as part of the City’s Midtown Master Plan. MADA will inhabit 4 acres of the total 64 acres that the City is redeveloping. MADA will renovate the Visual Arts Center, designed by Ricardo Legorreta, and the last remaining WWII military barracks to provide over 50,000 square feet of creative and cultural space for participating organizations and the Santa Fe community.

ASPECT STUDIOS
In December 2024, Aspect Film Studios was approved by the City to purchase of approx. 20 acres of the Midtown site to create world-class film production studios. In addition to film production studios, Aspect Studios plans to renovate The Screen, build approx. 300 units of housing, and renovate Driscoll Hall into a restaurant where Tender Fire pizza will be based. Together, MADA and Aspect Studios will help to ensure that the Midtown site continues as an arts, design, and creative cultural presence accessible to all Santa Feans.

Currently, the City is designing new infrastructure for the Midtown site, including new streets, stormwater management, and high speed internet. They will make open space improvements including an Arroyo Park and small Plaza. Infrastructure and site improvements for Phase 1 will start construction in 2026.
