Alliance partners will fully or partially relocate to the Midtown Site once the MADA buildings are renovated. Some Alliance partners will collaborate on significant programming partnerships.

Each Alliance partner participates in Governance, Resourcing, and Communications Working groups. This is a growing group of Alliance partners, so please spread the word and contact us if you know an organization that might be interested in partnering in Midtown!
