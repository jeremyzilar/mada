Santa Fe has a chance to prove that our city can turn vision into reality. Midtown isn’t just another parcel for development. It’s an investment in people, purpose, and possibility.

The Midtown Arts & Design Alliance (MADA), founded by local nonprofits, educators, and creative institutions, is working to turn the old college campus into a community hub for strengthening local arts and culture and training our next generation of creative entrepreneurs. Our vision stems from listening to what you, the community, want to see as this once-in-a-generation opportunity to reimagine Midtown, the geographic center of Santa Fe.

### Building the Future Santa Fe Has Asked For

Santa Fe needs creative spaces that reflect the heart of our communities — places that cultivate the talent and culture of New Mexicans and invite everyone in, not just a select few. We also need stable jobs and training in our growing creative industry, and opportunities for young people to stay here and thrive.

MADA answers all of these needs.

The plan is clear and impactful. MADA and non-profit partners will renovate existing buildings for programs preparing Santa Feans of all ages and income levels for the future. From creative industry training, to youth job pathway programs, a makerspace, and small-business incubators—MADA will be a creative and cultural asset in a thriving new neighborhood.

This is economic development and investment in the arts at the neighborhood level: practical, inclusive, and ready to move forward.

### What’s Holding MADA Back

The only thing standing in the way is the process itself.

For more than two years, MADA has worked in good faith with the City of Santa Fe to finalize a development agreement. We’ve followed every request, delivered every report, and raised millions of private dollars to prove our commitment.

But as a non-profit, we don’t have endless resources. Each delay has a cost. Momentum slows. Construction costs rise. Donor confidence weakens. The federal funding landscape shifts.

The longer the City hesitates, the harder it becomes to build. Let’s be clear: Santa Fe’s greatest threat right now isn’t creative risk. It is leadership.

The community is ready. Our partners are ready. The private sector is ready. The only question is whether City Hall can meet the moment with the urgency it deserves.

### A Shared Win

This isn’t about blame. It’s about opportunity. With an election around the corner, Santa Fe’s next mayor and council have a chance to start strong with a project that checks every box: job creation, youth opportunity, public-private partnership, and visible progress on one of the city’s most underused assets.

Imagine this:

- **Workforce training** that keeps Santa Fe’s youth employed here.
- **Creative industries** that diversify our economy.
- **Revitalized neighborhoods** where community and culture thrive.

That’s not just good policy. That’s leadership. There’s still time this year to set Midtown in motion — and to ensure the next administration can hit the ground running.

### A Call to Move Forward

MADA isn’t a gamble. It’s a plan, backed by years of work, credible partners, and millions in private commitment. It’s the chance for Santa Fe to do something we can all be proud of and show that this city can act decisively, work collaboratively, and build something lasting.

We urge the City to begin the new year with clear direction on Midtown, clear the red tape, and let this project move forward. MADA needs all of our elected officials to be champions of our project. Let’s make 2026 the year we stop talking about potential and start delivering results.

Because if we’ve learned anything, it’s this: when Santa Fe moves together, we build extraordinary things.
