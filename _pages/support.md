Santa Fe has long been a city of visionaries — artists, designers, and creative entrepreneurs who shape culture and push boundaries. The Midtown Arts & Design Alliance (MADA) project is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to transform the city’s iconic Ricardo Legorreta buildings and historic WWII barracks into a busy campus for community and innovation.
