### 1. What is MADA?

The Midtown Arts and Design Alliance (MADA) is an initiative led by the Santa Fe Art Institute, a nonprofit organization, and over 10 nonprofit partners and educational institutions. The project will repurpose 50,000 square feet of the Midtown site's striking buildings by Ricardo Legoretta and military barracks into an innovative district unlike anything in the region, anchoring an emerging new neighborhood.

### 2. What is MADA's mission?

The $25 million, multi-phased plan fosters creativity, promotes economic growth, and strengthens the community by providing space for creatives and nonprofits to collaborate and thrive. Residents across Santa Fe will benefit from their stronger programs and permanent partnership.

### 3. Are you redeveloping all of Midtown?

No. MADA is redeveloping 4 acres out of the 64-acre Midtown site that used to be the College of Santa Fe and Santa Fe University of Art and Design. The City of Santa Fe is responsible for other development within Midtown, and our vision complements the City's broader plans. MADA's scope includes the Visual Arts Center buildings and barracks constructed for the Brunns Military Hospital during WW II.

### 4. Who is in the "Alliance" and what does that mean?

Our name reflects a collaborative spirit in partnership with more than 10 highly respected organizations that will wholly or partially relocate to Midtown when the buildings are renovated. The group includes CENTER, Creative Startups, Girls Inc., Little Globe, Make Santa Fe, MASS Design Group, Santa Fe Indigenous Center, and UNM's College of Fine Art, School of Architecture and Planning, and School of Continuing Education, as well as Vital Spaces and YouthWorks.

### 5. What makes MADA so unique in Santa Fe?

Nothing else like it exists in New Mexico. The plan is modeled after successful community redevelopment projects in other states that are accessible, sustainable, and beneficial for the entire community. Programming will include a makerspace for all ages, printmaking and darkroom facilities, a youth-run job training café, design and construction training for youth, film and multi-media storytelling, plus ongoing lectures, workshops, classes, and civic events.

### 6. Is MADA purchasing property on the Midtown site?

No. Our plan will lease the City property through a long-term ground lease for 50 years at $1 per year. This allows us to sublease to partner organizations and creative enterprises at below-market rents that provide them with long-term sustainability. MADA is raising needed capital to renovate and improve the City-owned buildings as a form of civic infrastructure and investment in our social sector. The City plans to invest over $40 million in new infrastructure for roads, utilities, and stormwater management, to support the full redevelopment of the Midtown site.

### 7. What has been the timeline of the project?

**2018:** The Santa Fe University of Art and Design closed, leaving the campus vacant. SFAI remained as an independent nonprofit on site.

**2019:** MADA formed as an SFAI initiative and submitted a winning proposal to the City's Request for Expressions of Interest with KDC/Cienda. The City agreement with KDC/Cienda was later terminated.

**2020–2021:** SFAI led extensive community input sessions in partnership with UNM's Department of Architecture and Design, the City, and several nonprofits, with funding by the National Endowment for the Arts.

**Spring 2022:** Final community recommendations, including many from youth, low income residents, and Spanish speakers, informed the Midtown Master Plan.

**Fall 2022:** The Governing Body approved the Master Plan and issued an RFP for the Visual Arts Center for "Cultural Community-Oriented Use."

**March 2023:** MADA responded to the RFP for adaptive reuse of the Visual Arts Center and adjacent barracks.

**August 2023:** The Governing Body approved MADA's bid and executed an Exclusive Negotiation Agreement (ENA) for MADA to conduct feasibility and due diligence.

**November 2024:** MADA completed all financial analyses, building reports, and cost estimates, and began negotiating a long-term ground lease with the new Metropolitan Redevelopment Agency (MRA).

**December 2024:** The Governing Body extended the ENA to allow continued negotiation of MADA's Ground Lease and Development Agreement (GLDA) and approved the sale of City property to Aspect Film Studios – the first (and currently the only) Midtown redevelopment project.

**January–August 2025:** MADA advanced capital fundraising, public communications, and events while awaiting a legal document from the City.

**June 2025:** The ENA extension expired; MADA continued good-faith work with the City.

**July 2025:** The MRA director resigned over lack of City support.

**August 2025:** MADA received a draft legal document to negotiate with remaining MRA staff, the City Manager, and City Attorney. Several terms contradicted prior agreements and compliance already completed in 2024.

### 8. What is the current status of the project?

Legal negotiations on the Ground Lease and Development Agreement continue and MADA is awaiting City staff response.

### 9. What is needed for the project to move forward?

Once we reach agreement on terms with City staff, we need the Governing Body's approval. Strong community support and attendance at that Governing Body meeting in late 2025 or early 2026 will be important.

Once approved, the project is "greenlit" and can move forward with Phase 1. This includes completing construction documents, securing remaining fundraising needed for Phase 1, acquiring building permits, and starting construction.

### 10. Why is this project important?

**Capacity Building:** Supports the creative sector by providing affordable, sustainable space for creatives and organizations.

**Economic and Social Impact:** Invests in real estate to lower nonprofit rents and operating costs, and creates proximity and synergy for multiple organizations to collaborate on projects, job pathways, and youth programs for greater collective impact.

**Community Resilience:** Helps offset reductions in federal funding, contributing to social and economic stability.

### 11. When is the City Council meeting?

The meeting date has not yet been scheduled. We are waiting on the final legal terms from the City, after which our packet will be complete and we will receive a date to appear for a Council meeting.

### 12. How can the public support this project?

Your support is meaningful! Encouraging current and upcoming City Council members to reaffirm the value of this project and the positive impact it will have on Midtown's community is a vital step toward approval.

We encourage you to reach out to your Council members and urge them to vote for this vital project to move forward once we have a set meeting date. You can sign a letter of support [here](https://airtable.com/appqw8aswti0sLc5B/shr1YV2qqkRyx684H) or reach out to the Governing Body directly [here](https://www.santafenm.gov/governing_body).
