## Getting Started

### Editing pages in GitHub

If you need help with formatting, use [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/app#) to write and format in Markdown.

- Edit pages: https://github.com/jeremyzilar/mada/tree/main/_pages
- Edit Events: https://github.com/jeremyzilar/mada/blob/main/_data/events.yml

1. Make your edits
2. Commit changes
3. Wait 1-2 mins
4. Hard refresh in your browser `command + shift + r`

### To get set up locally:

```
$ yarn install
$ yarn dev
$ Open http://localhost:4000/
```

Any changes you make will be reflected on http://localhost:4000/

**To deploy:**

Push your changes to the `main` branch and they will be deployed to GitHub pages automatically. It usually takes 1-2 minutes for the changes to be reflected on https://mada.sfai.org
